Both model_1 (Gridsearch method) and model_2 (SVM method) had a best grid score of roughly 0.88. The Gridsearch method had a marginally higher score. These are high enough scores that we can expect that the models are able to predict new exoplanets with reasonable accuracy. In order to further improve the models, we could consider adding more parameters or adjusting the current parameters.
